## Stack & Features

Website built with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and deployed on Netlify. The backend is developed with Node JS and the database uses Mongo DB cloud-based solution.

### Main dependencies

-  Stripe (payment)
-  Axios (API requests)
-  JS Cookie (cookie management)
-  React Router Dom (navigation)

### Main features

#### Home page

-  Search bar: look through the database for offer title matching the input
-  Price switch: sort offers by ascending or descending price

#### Sign up and login

-  The password is never saved in the database to ensure maximum security.

-  Dropzone for file upload (at the moment only single file upload is supported). The dropzone offers picture preview and a button to remove the selected file.
-  Required fields: picture, title, description, price.

#### Offer page

-  The page displays the offer details.
-  If the offer has several pictures those will be displayed in a carousel.
-  Upon clicking the "purchase" button the user will be redirected to the checkout page if logged in. Otherwise the user will be redirected to the login page.

#### Checkout page
